**Title:** Matching Wealth Moments with Heterogeneous Returns (2025)  
**Authors:** Decory Edwards

**Abstract.** This paper aims to provide further evidence of the heterogeneous agent modelling framework’s ability to match wealth moments by adding a single source of heterogeneity across households beyond the realization of ex-post shocks to their income. I allow for households differ in the return earned on assets in a setting with rich life cycle dynamics. From there, I interpret the heterogeneity in the returns on safe assets earned by households as variation in deposit rates across the banking sector (as a result of the transmissions channel of monetary policy and its effect on deposits). Lastly, I discuss the implications of various taxation schemes when heterogeneous returns are present.
